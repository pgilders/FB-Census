# Social Media Census 

Scrape population data by age and country demographics from facebook & instagram based on ad analytics data.

Populations stored in csvs in the Data folder, column for each country, row for each 1 year age bracket from 18 to 65+ (i.e. all users 65 and older are in one category). By default each entry is the plain text range supplied by facebook / instagram. Also included is a file for facebook where the range suppied in each cell is replaced by the max value.

This data is the subject of study in _Ã–hman, C. J., & Watson, D. (2019). Are the dead taking over Facebook? A Big Data approach to the future of death online. Big Data & Society, 6(1), 2053951719842540_. Do let me know if you use it for your own projects, or would like expanded data sets.
